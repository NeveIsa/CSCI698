# Evolution/Recommendation in teaching

LACSG in 1993 initiated significant recommendations that raised awareness about the importance of the first course in linear algebra.

New technologies becoming available for teaching and learning purposes (PYTHON/YOUTUBE/MANIM/NUMPY), making technology more accessible and affordable for students.

Industry experts suggest a single semester course may not cover all essential topics, recommending quantitative analysis or STEM careers take at least two courses to gain a deeper understanding of the subject

Proof writing through linear algebra help individuals in industry assess the validity of algorithms and ideas, work with abstract variables, and understand system components' contributions to behavior

Industry experts support a review of the mathematical curriculum and role of linear algebra in the broader scheme, emphasizing importance of integrating linear algebra into STEM fields for a strong theoretical and computational foundation

# Role of technology

Making resources more accessible and affordable for students, enabling them to engage with the subject more effectively

Providing tools for visualization, computation, and exploration of linear algebraic concepts, enhancing understanding and retention of abstract mathematical ideas

Allowing for interactive learning experiences, simulations, and real-world applications that motivate students and provide insights into the practical relevance of linear algebra in various fields

Facilitating the integration of modern applications and technologies into the curriculum, aligning teaching methods with the demands of a quantitatively driven world and preparing students for careers in data science, signal processing, cryptography, computer science, and quantum computing

Supporting the development of critical thinking skills through hands-on activities, problem-solving tasks, and collaborative projects that deepen students' understanding of linear algebraic concepts and their applications in STEM disciplines
